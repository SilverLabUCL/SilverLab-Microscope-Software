# SilverLab-Microscope-Software

The SilverLab-Microscope-Software is mostly written in LabVIEW. It has been developed for use with the compact Acousto-Optic Lens Microscope (AOLM) developed in the Silver Lab at UCL. The software can perform multiple imaging modes and protocols including Z-stacks, multi-plane, single-plane, sub-volume, patches and points. It comes with a variety of ready-to-use tools for visualising the data acquired with the system. The software has a modular structure and can communicate with various peripherals. The software can be run on a Windows 10 platform with LabVIEW 2020 (32 bit & 64 bit, 64 bit preferred). The license can be found in the main folder. Detailed documentation on pre-requisites and how to use the software is available in the documentation folder.

Software natively works with Scientifica translation stage, but support is available for Brucker MAMC and Olympus IX (z motor) stages. Please contact us for core drivers and process for setup.

Microscope Software was created by The Silver Lab - R. Angus Silver - Department of Neuroscience, Physiology & Pharmacology - University College London - Gower Street - London WC1E 6BT – UK. http://silverlab.org/
