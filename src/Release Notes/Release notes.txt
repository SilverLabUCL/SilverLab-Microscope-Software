### Version 3.2.7
- DAQ FPGA bitfile for NI 7976R FPGA with 5772(01) AC coupled digitizer integrated. Users will have a choice to use either 
AC or DC by changing setting in a local configuration files
- Executable Build specifications updated in labview project file.
- Documentation updated to reflect newer changes in local configuration file management

### Version 3.2.6
- Major optimisation is movement control to make its operation reliable.
     - Optimisations in FPGA DAQ MC firmware (7976R)
     - MC reference placement calulation on host side bugs fixed
     - DAQ Bitfile upgraded to 'FPGA DAQ_2dzcorr_centre_optionalZ.lvbitx'
     - MC plots viewer has monitoring and MC auto-reset and user reset functionality added.
     - Saving reference plots during live imaging.
- Z stack freezing bug resolved.
- Option provided to disable objective position (Z position) range centering for free Z-stacks
- Mathscript code in Z stack calculations changed to 'G' code as mathscript will be phased out by NI
